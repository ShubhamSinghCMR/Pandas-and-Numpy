# Pandas and Numpy

A structured repository for practicing and exploring **Pandas** and **NumPy**, focusing on core concepts, data manipulation techniques, and numerical operations commonly used in **data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing**.

This repository is designed to build strong fundamentals through **hands-on examples**, covering how data is represented, transformed, analyzed, and prepared for downstream tasks such as visualization and modeling.

## Topics Covered

- NumPy arrays and numerical operations  
- Array indexing, slicing, and broadcasting  
- Vectorized computations for performance  
- Pandas Series and DataFrames  
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Filtering, grouping, and aggregation  
- Merging, joining, and reshaping datasets  
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Learning Approach

- Concept-driven examples with practical use cases  
- Focus on readable, well-structured code  
- Progressive difficulty from basics to applied patterns  
- Emphasis on operations frequently used in real-world workflows

## Use Cases

- Strengthening data analysis fundamentals  
- Preparing data for machine learning pipelines  
- Interview preparation and revision  
- Reference for common Pandas and NumPy patterns
